# OsrsHelper
First repository for Discord bot mainly made for osrs related things. 

**Very spaghetti code btw** because this was my very first project in coding. I apologize for no documentation and the code being in finnish. I'll be updating things to be more understandable as fast as I can.

# Source made with
- Python 3.6+
- `Beautifulsoup4` version 4.6.0
- `discord.py` version 0.16.12 **not rewrite**
- `pytz` version 2018.3
- `tabulate` version 0.8.2

Code should work with newer versions of these modules if no major updates are not made. Only exception is discord.py which will **not** work if updated to rewrite.
